# Cosmic-Ray_Transport_and_Gamma_Ray_Emission_in_M31

The notebookes used in this repository are made to spawn cosmic rays at specific acceleration sites within M31 and test out different diffusion scenarios from said sources to better understand the gamma ray emission observed throughout the galaxy. To run Cosmic Ray diffusion simulations, use the Final_simulation.ipynb notebook. Modifications to the simulation runs can be made by editing the Definitions.py file as needed.

Note: Running certain aspects of the simulation such as spawning cosmic rays at sources like star forming regions and pulsars may result in errors as specific files and images that only the members of the research group have are required. To obtain such information, email coeoconn@ucsc.edu.
